## Preface

Rubric initializes the configuration files of a few Python linters and formatters. Also, it adds a README.md boilerplace and a simple Makefile with the commands to apply the tools. This helps you maintain an isomorphic workflow across multiple projects. It assumes that, in all of your Python projects, you'll use‚Äî

* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) as the primary code formatter.
* [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to enforce consistent coding styles for multiple developers.
* [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) to sort the imports.
* [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) to ensure style guide conformance.
* [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to check the type hints.
* [Pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage the dependencies.
* [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for managing and maintaining the pre-commit hooks.


Following is a list of config files that Rubric is going to add to your target directory:

```
root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .editorconfig           # Config file for Editorconfig
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .flake8                 # Config file for .flake8
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore              # Python specific .gitignore file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .pre-commit-config.yaml # Config to manage pre-commit hooks.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                # Makefile containing the commands to lint your code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml          # Toml file to with the configs for mypy, black & isort
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # A readme boilerplate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements-dev.in     # File to specify the top level dev requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements-dev.txt    # File to specify the dev requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.in         # File to specify the top level app requirements
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # File to specify the pinned app requirements
```

The files will contain minimal but sensible default configurations for the respective tools. You're free to change them as you like.

## Installation

* Rubric requires Python 3.8 and up.

* Make a virtual environment in your project's root directory.

* Activate the environment and run:

    ```
    pip install rubric
    ```

## Usage

* To inspect all the CLI options, run:

    ```
    rubric --help
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```
    $ rubric --help
                   >> Config Initializer for Python Projects <<

    Usage: rubric [OPTIONS]

    Options:
    -h, --help                      Display help message.
    -v, --version                   Display the version number.
    -s, --show                      Show the contents of the config files.
    -a, --append                    Append to existing config files.
    -o, --overwrite                 Overwrite existing config files.
    -c, --create                    Create the config files in the current
                                    directory.
    -f, --filename [.editorconfig|.flake8|.gitignore|.pre-commit-config.yaml|README.md|Makefile|pyproject.toml|requirements-dev.in|requirements-dev.txt|requirements.in|requirements.txt]
                                    Target file names.
    -d, --dirname PATH              Target directory name.
    -l, --list                      List the config files that are about to be
                                    generated.

    ```

* Display a list of config files that are going to be created:

    ```
    rubric --list
    ```

    ```
    Config files that are about to be generated:

    => .editorconfig
    => .flake8
    => .gitignore
    => .pre-commit-config.yaml
    => README.md
    => Makefile
    => pyproject.toml
    => requirements-dev.in
    => requirements-dev.txt
    => requirements.in
    => requirements.txt
    ```

* Take a peek into the content of any config file(s):
    ```
    rubric --show -f requirements.txt -f .flake8
    ```

    This will print:

    ```

    =============================== requirements.txt ===============================

    #
    # This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with python 3.10
    # To update, run:
    #
    #    pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
    #

    =================================== .flake8 ===================================

    [flake8]
    extend-exclude =
        .git,
        __pycache__,
        docs/source/conf.py,
        old,
        build,
        dist,
        .venv,
        venv

    extend-ignore = E203, E266, E501, W605

    # Black's default line length.
    max-line-length = 88

    max-complexity = 18

    # Specify the list of error codes you wish Flake8 to report.
    select = B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9

    # Parallelism
    jobs = 4
    ```


* Initialize a project with the following command:

    ```
    rubric --create
    ```

    This will run the tool in a non-destructive way‚Äîthat means it won't overwrite any of the configuration files that you might have in the directory.

* If you only want to create a selected list of config files, then run:

    ```
    rubric --create -f requirements.txt -f requirements-dev.txt
    ```

* If you want to overwrite any of the existing config files that you might have in the directory, then run:

    ```
    rubric --overwrite -f filename1 -f filename2
    ```

* If you want to append the configs to an existing file, then run:

    ```
    rubric --append -f filename1 -f filename2
    ```

* You can also point Rubric to a directory.

    ```
    rubric --create --directory "some/custom/directory"
    ```

* If you want to check and update the configs across multiple repositories in a single sweep, use the following command:

    ```
    s="dir1 dir2 dir3"; echo $s | xargs -n 1 -P $(echo $s | wc -w) rubric -c -d
    ```

    This command will spawn 3 processes to create the config files in `dir1`, `dir2`, and `dir3` in parallel.

* You can run the entire linter suite with this command:

    ```
    make lint
    ```
